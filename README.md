Clone the repository and open the terminal and do the following:

`npm install`

`node index.js`

You should see by now that the server is up and running on PORT 500.

Now do the following to run the frontend:

`cd views`

`npm install`

`yarn start`

Now a browser should open up which allows you to upload images to a cloud repository.
